    <h1>A Shy Kitty's Story</h1>
    
    <p>
      This project was adapted from Michael Hartl's <a href="http://twitter.com/learnenough" target="_blank"></a><em>Learn Enough to Be Dangerous Series</em></a>, a pretty amazing tutorial series started by the Ruby on Rails Tutorial. But this is not that website. This is a move beyond in developing my own personalized website. It's also a bit of fun admist all the tutorials. Every day that I'm involved with web development practice. the more intested I become in making some type of career move into more of it. <a href="https://shy-kitty.herokuapp.com/">Visit Shy-Kitty now!.</a>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the
      Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one:
    </p>

    <blockquote style="padding: 2px 20px; background: #999;">
      <p>
        <em>Cats have it all - admiration, an endless sleep, and company only when they want it.</em>
        <br>
        â€”Rod McKuen
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    
    <p>
      Shy Kitty is like Hello Kitty, but doesn't say as much because she's shy. This site was conceived as a partially stylized version of the tutorial that I was working on at the time. It's name was inspired by the Heroku generated app name, which struck me as both very Japanese and with a subtle appeal. The original name was something like gentle-meadow889136. Since then, I've now gone through several web development, and returning the HTML lesson was a filling in of some of the missed details in doing the full rails tutorial.

      Andrew is currently an aspiring web developer. His current day job is that of a Manufacturing Process Developer <em>(a job title that he is pretty sure that his company made up)</em> at <a hfer="http://www.chroma.com">Chroma Technology Corp</a>. For the most part it's a decent paying job at an employee owned company. However, it's not currently feeding my sould, and I'm up for a bit more challenge and creativity. Thus, this website is the result of that desire.
