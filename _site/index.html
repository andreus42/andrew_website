    <h1>A Shy Kitty's Story</h1>
    
    <p>
      This project was adapted from Michael Hartl's <a href="http://twitter.com/learnenough" target="_blank"></a><em>Learn Enough to Be Dangerous Series</em></a>, a pretty amazing tutorial series started by the Ruby on Rails Tutorial. But this is not that website. This is a move beyond in developing my own personalized website. It's also a bit of fun admist all the tutorials. Every day that I'm involved with web development practice. the more intested I become in making some type of career move into more of it. <a href="https://shy-kitty.herokuapp.com/">Visit Shy-Kitty now!.</a>

      <h2>Quotations</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the
        Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one:
      </p>
  
      <blockquote style="padding: 2px 20px; background: #999;">
        <p>
          <em>Cats have it all - admiration, an endless sleep, and company only when they want it.</em>
          <br>
